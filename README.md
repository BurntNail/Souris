# Souris

A tiny `no_std` database designed to minimise size over all else.

Named after mice, because they're tiny.

## Usage
Use the `sourisd` service to run a daemon on your local machine, and then `souris` to modify local databases or to modify `sourisd` databases.

## NB:
This project is currently not far off being finished but also not that close. I also have a major problem with endless scope creep (which in fairness, isn't really a problem if I'm learning new things).

However, I also have exams relatively soon and so this project is going into hibernation. Make no mistake, I still have plenty of interest in making this - I have ideas about everything from float & string storage to some pretty hacky hacks i want to excise but I need to stop, or this will have a lasting impact on my future.
